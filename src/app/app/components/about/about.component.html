      This application sacrificed a loot of blood, sweat and tears until it was finished. It was 100% intended
      for <b>learning purposes</b> and has therefore no <b>commercial income</b>. This application uses images from the

        Why a Clash app? I'm for several year a passionate Clash of Clans player with a maxed townhall 9 account. My focus
        are clan wars. It keeps me playing constantly to progress alongside with my friends. Thanks on Clash for providing
        us with in game data.

        This project integrates great libraries and frontend frameworks such as Chart.js, Bootstrap, Ag-grid, Firebase and many more.
        Furthermore this application process with complex data structure, async data flow and was a great practise for me in my
        pretty young frontend career. If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me on: <b><em>L.__marco@hotmail.de</em></b>.
